# 🍥 My Shinobi Path: Learning Solana Native Contracts

> "I'm gonna be the Hokage of Solana development!" - Me, probably

## 📜 What I'm Doing Here

Yo! So I'm learning how to write **Solana Native Contracts** using Rust. No Anchor framework, just pure native Solana programs. It's like learning the Rasengan without any shortcuts - harder, but you really understand what's going on under the hood.

## 🎯 My Training Arc

### What I'm Working On
- **Counter Program** - Starting simple. It's like my first Shadow Clone jutsu - basic but essential.

### What I'm Learning
- **Rust** - The language I need to master
- **Solana Program Library (SPL)** - All the tools I'll need
- **Native Solana Contracts** - Writing programs without Anchor
- **Account Management** - How to handle data on Solana
- **Transaction Processing** - Making stuff actually work

## 🔥 My Approach

```
1. Write the contract
2. Break it (probably)
3. Fix it (hopefully)
4. Test it thoroughly
5. Deploy and celebrate
6. Repeat
```

## 📚 Resources I'm Using

- [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/)
- [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)
- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## 🌟 My Progress

- [x] Set up the workspace
- [ ] Understand basic program structure
- [ ] Learn how accounts work
- [ ] Figure out instruction processing
- [ ] Deploy my first program to devnet
- [ ] Build something actually useful
- [ ] Become a Solana ninja

## ⚡ Commands I'm Using

```bash
# Build my contract
cargo build-bpf

# Run tests
cargo test

# Deploy when ready
solana program deploy target/deploy/your_program.so
```

## 💭 Notes to Self

- Don't give up when it gets hard (that's my ninja way!)
- Read error messages carefully (they're trying to help)
- Test everything before deploying
- Native contracts are harder than Anchor, but I'll learn more

**Believe it!** 🍜

*This is my journey to becoming a Solana developer.*
